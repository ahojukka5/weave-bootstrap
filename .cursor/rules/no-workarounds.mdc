# No Workarounds Policy

## Core Principle

**We never do workarounds. Never.**

If there is a design question where we have to choose between:
- A dirty quick fix or workaround
- Doing the right thing and fixing code properly

**We always choose the latter.**

We don't care how long it takes. We are proud software developers and never compromise our quality standards.

## Guidelines

1. **No shortcuts**: If a problem requires a proper fix, take the time to implement it correctly
2. **No temporary solutions**: Temporary fixes become permanent problems
3. **No type system hacks**: If there's a type error, fix the root cause, don't work around it
4. **No comment-based workarounds**: Don't add comments like "TODO: fix this properly" - fix it now
5. **No "good enough" solutions**: If it's not the right solution, it's not acceptable

## Examples

### ❌ Bad: Workaround
```weave
;; Workaround: avoid type check by using different pattern
(let head Int32 (arena-first-child a node))
(if-stmt (!= head (- 0 1))
  ;; Assume it's a list if head exists
  (do ...)
)
```

### ✅ Good: Proper Fix
```weave
;; Properly check the node kind
(if-stmt (== (arena-kind a node) (node-kind-list))
  (do ...)
)
```

## When Facing a Problem

1. Understand the root cause
2. Design the proper solution
3. Implement it correctly
4. Test thoroughly
5. Never compromise on quality

Quality is not negotiable. Time spent on proper fixes is time well invested.
